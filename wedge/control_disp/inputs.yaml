  description: >
    Controlled displacement test with a 30 m hull offset to intentionally bias
    the wedge. This captures the shorter runs discussed before the multi-hour
    sweep.

simulation:
  hull_offset: 30.0
  outer_offset: 0.0
  initial_perturb: 0.1
  damping: 30000.0
  dt: 0.05
  total_time: 10000.0
  track_shells: [1, 5, 10, 15]
