  description: >
    Multi-hour (100,000 s) run to observe the final steady state when a large
    initial offset is imposed. Notes mention the effective hull offset being
    about 20 m for this case.

simulation:
  hull_offset: 20.0
  outer_offset: 0.0
  initial_perturb: 0.1
  damping: 30000.0
  dt: 0.05
  total_time: 100000.0
  track_shells: [1, 5, 10, 15]
