  description: >
    Initial coupled simulation that still relied on the short-journal force
    model; includes the vanilla run plus a repeat with higher damping.
  notes:
    - Hull and envelope remained concentric.
    - Shell 1 received the nominal 0.1 m perturbation.

simulation:
  hull_offset: 0.0
  outer_offset: 0.0
  initial_perturb: 0.1
  damping: 30000.0
  dt: 0.05
  total_time: 1000.0
  track_shells: [1, 5, 10, 15]
